# Onomatopoeicator -- Creating funny Hungarian onomatopoeic words

A little experiment on creation of Hungarian onomatopoeic words (verbs) with a few simple rule.

Have fun! :)

The basic ide a came from Gerstner (2006) and from the [Wikipedia](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangut%C3%A1nz%C3%B3_sz%C3%B3#Hangut%C3%A1nz%C3%B3_szavak_alkot%C3%A1sa).

Dedicated to √Ågnes Kalivoda, who can make science and fun together even from the seemingly boring verbal particles!
